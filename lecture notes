# Data types can be either numerical or categorical
# Numerical can be discrete (you can count it)... fractions of discrete values is still discrete; need not be a whole number... unit is object of measurement
# Numerical can be continuous (related to a measurement process)... your height falls on a continuum... units describe the thing we measure
# Categorical can be nominal (any designation where order does not matter)
# Categorical can be ordinal (any designation where order does matter)
# Categorical can be Rank (elements ordered within a single category)... if a new person is added, it has the potential to change the order... adding a data point influences other data points

# class function is a diagnostic tool to know your data type

class(yale$Year)
#returns integer since vector contains all numbers, no decimals
class(yale$Height)
# if one height is reported as a decimal, will return 'numeric'

char = c("203", "208")
class(char)
#returns character since data points are in quotes

#ordering:
table(yale$Class)
#returns data alpha-numerically 

#use this code to order dataset as you wish
yale$Class = ordered(yale$Class, levels = c("Fy.", "So.", "Jr.", "Sr.", "Gr."))
class(yale$Class)
levels(yale$Class)

#The mean
#an abstraction from your data... not necessarily in your dataset and represent something about it
